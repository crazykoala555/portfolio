                        This project takes a view at a public-facing interface. Through observation of the interface use by other users,
                        as well as interviews, I was able to generate a set of personas and a storyboard for the given interface.

                        My chosen interface is the control system for an oven and stove top appliance. There are three main
                        components to the interface illustrated above. The four knobs surround the center, for controlling
                        the stove top burners. The center console relates to controlling the oven, as well as time-related
                        functions. The center digitizer displays time, as well as any time and oven-related information,
                        like temperature and timer. Each button, if applicable, is grouped with other buttons based on function.
                        The interface in general tries to provide a set of controls to control the main functions of the appliance,
                        that being cooking in the oven or using the stovetops.

                            During the research process, I was able to observe and interview three
                            different users which used the interface. Between each user there were definitely similarities
                            and differences in processes as each one used the kitchen appliance. Here are my observations:

                            <p>Most users seemed fairly confident when using the stove top interface, but when
                                tasked with operating the oven, showed a bit of confusion to which button corresponded to what,
                                and
                                in what exact order things needed to be pressed. One common thing is that each user only ever
                                used one
                                of the functions of the appliance at a time, either the oven or the stove top, not both.
                                Notably, user 1, when using the
                                stove, first tried to turn the knob to "HI" first, compared to user 3, who turned the knob to
                                "LO" first. Users 2
                                and 3, when setting the timer for cook time, both overshot their expected time and had to use
                                the "-" button
                                in order to return to their desired cook time. What I found interesting was that those who used
                                the stove top
                                burners didn't get confused about needing to push knob in, there are no indicators saying that
                                is needed. Most
                                likely known from previous experience.

                                <li>What item first draws your attention when looking at the system controls?</li>
                                <li>What would you do to turn on the front left stove-top burner?</li>
                                <li>What would you do to turn on the oven?</li>

                                        input of temperatures/times, needing to go back and fix it.

                    people who may use this appliance: those who are cooking just to eat, and would rather be doing something else, and those
                    who enjoy the process of cooking more, and will spend more time doing it. See the empathy maps below:

                                    User 1 is a person who is not super interested in the process of cooking, and kind of just wants the
                                    food to be done as quickly as possible. <br/>
                                    By trying to speed through everything so that they are able to go onto the next task, user 1 pays a bit
                                    less attention to instructions, and prioritizes speed over everything else. They regularly overshoot numbers
                                    when trying to dial in settings, and have to go back to fix it. They are fairly impatient and don't want to
                                    spend time looking up how to use the appliance, sometimes making mistakes and pressing the wrong buttons, getting
                                    frustrated with the appliance. <br/>
                                    This persona is very similar to those who don't really enjoy cooking, and simply do it because they need sustenance.
                                    They, therefore want to cook for the shortest time possible, taking shortcuts, making mistakes, and being impatient.
                                    In observations, you can see how this user appears, noting how some stuff is too complex, and would rather use the
                                    simpler toaster oven instead. There are also notes of how users typically thing the interface is too slow when inputting information.

                                    User 2 is a person who enjoys the process of cooking, and notably, takes their time when operating
                                    the appliance interface. <br/>
                                    By taking their time with everything and enjoying the process of cooking, user 2 pays more attention
                                    to the appliance controls, and refers to their phone if they get confused. Ah, the wonders of the internet!
                                    While the controls seem a bit confusing when operating the oven, and they don't really understand how the other
                                    timer functions work, they stick with what they know and remain calm. <br/>
                                    This persona is very similar to those who do enjoy cooking, as those who enjoy are more likely to take their time
                                    and enjoy the process, remaining calm and extremely patient while their food cooks. By remaining calm, they're able
                                    to take their time working with the inputs of the system, and even if confusing, turning to the internet to correctly
                                    using the appliance.

                        All done! From this project, I was able to select an interface, observe users, and generate useful tools
                        which represent different types of users. These tools can help me come to a better understanding overall
                        of how the interface is used, and how it can be improved to better cater to the users observed during the
                        project. Understanding your users is crucial to understanding how you can better tailor a product to a user's
                        needs. These empathy maps and storyboards help me understand truly what the user is thinking, and what I
                        can do to make the frustrations and grievances disappear.
