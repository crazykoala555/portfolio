                            The purpose of this project was to gain a better understanding of how to create a responsive, constantly
                            updating site based in React. It contains an aggregator, as well as a filtering and sorting system of sorts.
                            Creating a site that is able to update based on state changes can be extremely helpful, it means that constant
                            pings to a backend for computation aren't necessary for simple tasks, and can be done in the frontend. Almost every
                            modern site uses some form of states in order to keep interactions quick and efficient, which only increases the
                            importance of learning how to do it myself.

                            For this project, I created the game zone.
                            It contains three main sections: The filter and sort section, the list section, and the cart section.
                            This application is designed for users to view games, and purchase them.
                            The user is able to view a summary of the store in the center screen.
                            The user is able to add items to their cart, and estimate the cost of purchasing games at a given price.

                        I'm able to accomplish functionality through React's use of states, props, and more.
                        The user's cart, filter selections, sorting selection, and store visibility all have their own
                        stored state. Whenever the user presses a button in any of the sections, the respective state is changed.
                        For example, when a filter box is unchecked, the state of checked boxes is changed, which triggers a function
                        to filter out items in the store, change the store's state, and update it visually in the application.
                        Every user action fires a function which leads to a state change.

                       Using React, I was able to explore the use of states and understand how exactly to create a webapp
                        that, using frontend computation, would perform a set of tasks adequately. With this knowledge, I was able
                        to capture user input, cause state updates, and update information accordingly in other sections of the site.
                        Linking each section through a series of props and states allowed me to keep everything synchronized and come to
                        a better understanding of the concepts of a whole.
